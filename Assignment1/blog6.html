            <h2>REEDSY – THE ONE-STOP SHOP FOR WRITERS?</h2>
            <img src="img/bird.png" class="sixth-blog-img"/>
            <p class="section-text">About eighteen months ago <a href="https://authordylanhearn.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/reedsy-a-new-resource-for-writers/" style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">I wrote a post about a new startup, Reedsy,</a>
                 who were looking to develop a marketplace to bring authors
                 and publishers together with the best editing, cover design and book marketing professionals. At the time I thought it was an intriguing idea, as 
                 indie authors were realising that for their books to be taken seriously they needed to be well-written, well-edited and have a professional cover 
                 but it was difficult to know where to find the best possible support. At the same time, I was concerned that this was yet another service looking 
                 to earn income from authors (and publishing professionals) without delivering any real value in return.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">Since my last post, Reedsy has grown, developing it’s services and website, so I thought it was time to revisit what they offer.</p>
            <p class="section-text" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Full disclosure: Ricardo Fayet, one of the founders of Reedsy, has read and given great reviews of my books. This has no impact on this post and I have never been 
                requested to write anything about Reedsy. I also have not used the Reedsy marketplace to find a publishing professional but my editor offers his services via Reedsy.
            </p>
            <p class="under">What’s new?</p>
            <p class="section-text">Where the old Reedsy was pretty much the market place, allowing authors to search for marketing professionals and professionals to promote themselves, Reedsy now offer a lot more.</p>
            <p class="under" style="font-size: 18px;">Learning</p>
            <p class="section-text">They have a series of free <a href="https://blog.reedsy.com/live/" style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">Live Videos</a> where industry experts talk about specific topic (e.g. cover critiques, how to go about your second draft), all of which are really useful for a novice or experienced writer. They also offer a 
                series of free courses on topics as diverse as how to build your writing routine to getting the most from Amazon’s algorithms. The best thing about these services are that you don’t have to be registered with Reedsy to take part 
                (although the courses are via email so you do have to give you name and email address). Even if you don’t use any of Reedsy’s other services, these are well worth having a look at.
            </p>
            <p class="under" style="font-size: 18px;">Book editor</p>
            <p class="section-text">Reedsy have also created a book editor, free software for you to use to write your novel. Because it is online, you can use it to collaborate with your editor and once complete it can create the final ebook or 
                POD file for you. My thoughts on this are mixed. In function it is very similar to Scrivener – which I love – and the fact it is free makes it very attractive. However I have two concerns. First, by using this service you are tying 
                yourself to Reedsy in the same way some of us are tied over time to Google or Apple products. I’d want to know how to access my files if I change my mind. Second is around the files themselves. Where are they stored? Who owns them? 
                What happens if Reedsy goes bust? It’s not clear from the promotional page and I would want clear answers on these points if I was ever to think about using the service.
            </p>
            <p class="under" style="font-size: 18px;">The market place</p>
            <p class="section-text">The market place has developed since I last looked from being predominantly editors and cover designers to now promoting PR, Marketing and Ghostwriting services as well. You can filter your search by the type of service 
                offered and the genre they specialise in to help find the right person for you. What is noticeable is that there hasn’t been a significant rise is the number of professionals offering their services. For me, this is a good thing. It shows that 
                Reedsy aren’t just trying to pull in numbers to make a quick buck but are
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">One thing that’s knew is you can see the response rate of the professional, so you know whether your enquiry will be looked at or not. It’s a nice addition but I’d still like to have some form of rating or feedback where verified 
                users of the service can give feedback of their experience. I would also like to have some indication of an indicative price range as it’s difficult to tell initially whether you would be wasting your (and the service provider’s) time with an enquiry.
            </p>
            <p class="under" style="font-size: 18px;">Summary</p>
            <p class="section-text">As an author, I like what Reedsy are doing and the way they are approaching the market. They appear to be in it for the long haul and are choosing quality over quantity, and are building up a portfolio of services to support authors 
                and offer real value. While I don’t think their offer is perfect, if they continue in this manner they could soon become the one-stop shop for authors they’re aiming to be.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">At the very least, I would recommend anyone interested in writing to check out their learning videos and courses, whether you are starting out and looking to develop your craft, or if you are an experienced writer looking to learn move 
                about the intricacies of the trad or indie publishing scene. They cover a wide variety of topics and are delivered by market experts. Also, they’re free, so what do you have to lose?
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">On a personal level I’m lucky that I already have an editor and cover designer I enjoy working with, but if I was ever looking for a professional service, I would definitely look on Reedsy on top of my other searches.</p>
            <p class="section-text">What about you? Have you used Reedsy at all? Do you have any feedback you would like to share with us? I would love to hear from you.</p>

                            I’ve seen so many posts from reviewers calling it a day for this reason. Its so sad that people feel forced to 
                            give up the joy of talking about books because of a few idiots.
